# Before you file a bug...

* Is this a question, or are you looking for help? Ask it in our [discussions area](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/discussions/) instead.
* Did you [read the documentation](https://xunit.net/)?
* Did you search the issues list to see if someone already reported it? _When looking for duplicates, make sure to look through open **and** closed issues._
* Did you create a simple repro for the problem? _We won't look at your bug until you provide a repro project or complete repro steps._

# Before you submit a PR...

* Did you ensure this is an [accepted 'help wanted' issue](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22)? (If not, please start a [discussion](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/discussions/) first.)
* Did you read the [project governance](https://xunit.net/governance)?
* Does the code follow existing coding styles? (spaces, comments, no regions, etc.)?
* Did you write unit tests?
